# 🌳 tree-sitter-manager.nvim

A lightweight Tree-sitter parser manager for Neovim.

## 📜 Why this plugin?

This plugin was created following the **archival of the [nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) repository** in April 2026. This marked the end of convenient one-plugin parser management.

**tree-sitter-manager.nvim** provides a minimal alternative for:
- Installing and removing Tree-sitter parsers
- Automatically copying queries for syntax highlighting
- Managing parsers through a clean TUI interface

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 Install parsers directly from Tree-sitter repositories
- ⚡ Dynamic FileType autocmd registration for installed parsers
- 🔧 Works with any plugin manager (lazy, packer, vim-plug, native packages)

## 📋 Requirements

### Mandatory
- **Neovim 0.12+** 
- **tree-sitter CLI** 
- **git** (for cloning parser repositories)
- **C compiler** (gcc/clang for building parsers)

### Optional
- Nerd Font (for proper display of icons ✅❌📦)

## 📦 Installation

### lazy.nvim
```lua
{
  "romus204/tree-sitter-manager.nvim",
  dependencies = {}, -- tree-sitter CLI must be installed system-wide
  config = function()
    require("tree-sitter-manager").setup({
      -- Optional: custom paths
      -- parser_dir = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/site/parser",
      -- query_dir = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/site/queries",
    })
  end
}
```

## 🚀 Usage

`:TSManager` - Open the parser management interface

## ⌨️ Keybindings
	
`i` - Install parser under cursor  
`x` - Remove parser under cursor  
`r` - Refresh installation status  
`q / <Esc>` - Close window  

## 📚 Queries
Syntax highlighting queries (highlights.scm, injections.scm, etc.) were sourced from the archived [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)
 repository and placed in `runtime/queries/`.

## 🔗 Parser Repository Links

Parser repository URLs in `repos.lua` are sourced from the archived [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) repository. 

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: These links are provided as-is. Due to the large number of parsers, each URL cannot be manually verified for current availability or compatibility. If you encounter a broken link, outdated revision, or build failure, please:
> - Open an [issue](https://github.com/romus204/tree-sitter-manager.nvim/issues) with details
> - Or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/romus204/tree-sitter-manager.nvim/pulls) with a fix

Your contributions help keep this plugin reliable for everyone. 🙏

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Unix-first development: Primarily tested on macOS/Linux. Windows support may require additional testing.
- Requires tree-sitter CLI: Ensure tree-sitter is available in your $PATH.
- No auto-updates: To update a parser, remove it (x) and reinstall (i).
